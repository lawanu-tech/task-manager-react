1. **Time Spent on the Coding Test:**
   I spent approximately 1 day working on the coding test, from initial setup to completion.

2. **Most Useful Feature in the Latest Version of React:**
   One of the most useful features in recent versions of React is the introduction of React Hooks, which provide a way to use state and other React features without writing a class. Here's how I've used it in the provided project:

   ```javascript
   import { useState, useEffect } from "react";

   function App() {
       const [tasks, setTasks] = useState([]);
       // Other hook implementations...
   }
   ```

    In this example, `useState` is a React Hook that allows me to add state to a     functional component.

3. **Tracking Down Performance Issues in Production:**
   To track down performance issues in production, I follow these steps:
   - Check browser tools like Chrome or Firefox for any obvious issues, like slow loading times or large files.
   - Use simple tools like Google Analytics to see if there are any spikes in traffic that might be causing slowdowns.
   - Keep an eye on error messages or warnings that pop up and try to fix them.
   - Test different versions of our site to see if changes we make improve performance.

   Yes, I once found a problem with our site's JavaScript that was using too much memory. I fixed it by finding the code causing the issue and making it more efficient.

4. **Additional Features or Improvements for the Task Management Application:**
   If I had more time, here are some additional features or improvements I would consider adding to the task management application:
   - User authentication and authorization system to allow multiple users to manage their own tasks securely.
   - Ability to assign tasks to specific users or teams.
   - Export feature: Implement functionality to export tasks to common file formats such as CSV or PDF, allowing users to save and share task lists externally
